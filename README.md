# FlaskApp2
This is another version of our FeelsApp with an updated and more modular structure of the app.

Also, this app was created with flask via virtualenv following tutorials created by [Lalith Polepeddi](https://github.com/lpolepeddi) before being modified. - *P.s: Thanks Lalith!*

### **Before cloing this git!**  
Here are some linux-based commands required to have the app set up for development. 

##### **NOTICE !!**  
*If you're running Windows, follow the "Installation Instructions" on [this link](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) to get easy_install up and running on your computer.*

##### Installing virtualenv
If you already have virtualenv installed on your system, 
you will see a version number. Do the following command to check:  

```sh
$ sudo easy_install virtualenv
```  
or:
```sh
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
```  
or:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

##### Installing Flask
After installing virtualenv, do the following command:

```sh
$ virtualenv flaskapp
```
This creates a new isolated development environment in your current directory.  
Then, make the new dev-env your present working directory like so:
```sh
$ cd flaskapp
$ . bin/activate
```
Finally, install Flask:
```sh
$ pip install Flask
```
##### ***WAIT !!***  
Here are some additional flask components/frameworks that must be installed to have the app working correctly after cloning this git later:

```sh
$ pip install flask-wtf
$ pip install flask-mail
$ pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```
You may also need to install mysql to have a database running.  
First, check to see if your system already has MySQL:

```sh
$ mysql --version
```
If the command was not found, you'll need to install MySQL.  
There are several ways to do so. You may follow the instructions below:  

##### First Method
1. Via Homebrew:  
 - type the following command to install Homebrew.
    ```sh
    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```
    Hit agree to install and then hit return to continue in the terminal when prompted.
- After Homebrew is installed, do the two following commands to check if homebrew has been successfully installed, then get commonly used packages:
	```sh
	$ brew doctor
	$ brew install wet
	```
- Finally, install mysql:
 	```sh
 	$ brew install mysql
 	```

##### Second Method
2. Install via apt-get commands, like such:  
	```sh
	$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client
	```

##### ***Finally...*** 
You may clone this git to your ***isolated development*** `flaskapp folder`.  

##### ***Don't forget...***  
To continue developing this app in an ***isolated environment*** in the `flaskapp folder`, remember to always do the following command:
```sh
$ . bin/activate
```  
###### ***Also...***  
To have the contact page notify you at your personal email address, remember to change the following lines in [routes.py](/routes.py) to an actual existing email login info.
```python
app.config["MAIL_USERNAME"]='your-username@gmail.com'  
app.config["MAIL_PASSWORD"]='your-password'
```
